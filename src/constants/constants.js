  description:"\nThis project initiative and related research were funded by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). It was developed and shown as a web-based multiplayer small group simulation to support instructor-led HazMat personnel health and safety training. Individuals will gain expertise in the anticipated roles at common incidents and work sites as a result of the implementation of this low-cost simulation. This provides HazMat employees with the necessary repetition in diverse jobs for learning and skill development. Simulations can promote performance and learning in real-world circumstances (on-the-job training) or live training events. You may utilize the critical factors to form your command selections by studying conditions around your location and tracking response timings.",
